Flipkart Product Explorer and Recommendation System (ADT Project)

##Project Summary:

Utilizing a dataset procured from Kaggle, one of India's foremost e-commerce platforms, our database application intends to furnish enriched shopping insights to online consumers. Our project, aimed at identifying e-shoppers and analysts, aims to uncover detailed patterns in product evaluations, price, and user preferences. 

E-commerce platforms can frequently present a daunting experience for customers, particularly in scenarios where an extensive array of products is available. Harnessing the extensive dataset extracted from Flipkart.com, our database application aspires to empower users with detailed insights into products, reviews, and pricing. Navigating the website, conducting product searches, and making product comparisons can be challenging tasks for customers, potentially leading to a sense of overwhelm and frustration. The Product Tracker can help customer find products who doesn’t know what they are looking for and get details about like discounted price and review making their task easier.

Smart Spending: Price tracking enables users to be savvy shoppers. By identifying the categories with the most substantial discounts, users can strategically allocate their budgets to maximize their savings.

Budget Management: Users can employ the tracker to determine if a specific product aligns with their budget before making a purchase. This feature enables users to make financially responsible decisions, ensuring that they stay within their desired spending limits and avoid overspending on product.

Customer-Centric Retail: This application uses data such as customer reviews,
and ratings, discounts offered, and other preferences to provide detail review of product that will help customer to get information in one-go and help in their decision to buy products.
